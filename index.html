    <!-- I have tried what feels like seven million ways to make this fully mobile responsive and I just can't seem to make it work out right, but this would be my general setup for it/the way I've gotten the closest. Presuming I could get the actual side-nav menu to come out of the little hamburger menu, it would be just fine. I have a CSS media query that I thought would work and a little bit of JS that I found online but it's still not working ¯\_(°╭╮°)_/¯ not entirely sure where I'm going wrong. I've played with the idea of just coding it out as a container (I'll include what that would look like below commented out) but there's got to be a way to do it using Materialize elements too -->

        <p class="flow-text first-about">Samantha Flores recently finished a web development coding bootcamp at UCI, an experience that packed all aspects of
        full stack development into about 6 months' worth of classes, all completed in addition to a ful-time job. With an
        emphasis on both solo and group projects, the class focused on mobile-first development and React applications. While
        she worked on all aspects of the applications so was involved in, Samantha's favorite aspect of development is front-end
        work, especially anything with React or JavaScript.

        <p class="flow-text">Samantha prefers to be called Sam or Sammi--Samantha makes her feel like she's in
          trouble for something.
          Sam is a lover of coffee, books, superheroes, and science, in aproximately that order. She'll take her
          coffee almost any way you serve it, as long as there's a lot of it. You don't want to see her without
          her daily caffeine fix. In terms of books, Sammi will read almost anything--she read 32 last year alone
          from a wide variety of genres and authors and is always looking for recommendations. Robin and Batman
          are her favorite superheroes, in that order. If given the chance, she wouold run away to be the next
          Robin. Science will always be here favorite subject, but she's hoping to find a new passion for web
          development after taking this class.
